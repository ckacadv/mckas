Rules of this game are very simple. There is a gray hole that is surrounded with honeycombs.  The problem is that the hole can't reach them so you will have to help it a little bit. Your job is to grab the honeycombs as fast as possible and drop them off into the hole. The more you feed it the hungrier it gets. Do not let your hole starve to death. You can see how hungry it is with the hunger bar at the top. If it runs out you will lose, also the higher the score the faster it discharges. Good luck playing!

More detailed instructions on how to play are in the game.
