I will do it "the rigt way" this time. I already had something that i dont really think can be called an api, it was and is just a website like this one (as.macakom.net). But the problem with that was you can only pull data from it, not give it any. That is fine for 90% of functions in lets say Macakom Desktop but you could not interact with your account. You have to message me or email me about what you want to change. I hope that will come to an end once i figure this all out with hosting and more importantly securing it all. I am planning on making it public and letting other people to use my login sistem for auth for whatever reason. Also a really cool thing is that now i can make a web page where you can view your account so a program will not be necessary, i will keep you up to date.
