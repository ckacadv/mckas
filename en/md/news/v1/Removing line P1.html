This is also the first post in 2025! So, after a long time it being dark i will finally remove it completely. This line was also first actual Macakom Network's let's say "long distance" copper line ever placed. It didn't have much use so after a year or two of operation i will pull it out. But that means that another line will pop up now! I still don't know how to name it but it will mainly be used for telephone or some other form of sound. Maybe even some power cuz imma go underground this time instead of air. Also i am planning some other projects that might need communication at certain places so it surely wont be a waste of wire. I'm planning on getting an actual pbx so calls can be made instead of just talking on 12v wire. If i start other projects regarding telphony or communication or dial up i will write about it of course.
