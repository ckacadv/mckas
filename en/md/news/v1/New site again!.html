<h2>New site again!</h2><br>
<b>Date unknown</b><br><br><br>
I redesigned this poor site once again because i felt like doing it. This is 3rd major version so far. First there was html but it was made in publisher so that doesnt really count. 2.0 was a JavaScript app actually that looked and behaved very good on my pc and in IDE but not in a web browser so that didnt last long. And finally we have this version that i started and finished making on 3rd of June 2024. (Most of things i stole from W3Schools but i figured out how to arrange things by myself so thats something) I hope this change will be the las one in a while now because this one looks kinda nice and its easy to maintain (unlike ones made in Publisher).
