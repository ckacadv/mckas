<h3>Macakom API</h3><br>
I will do it "the rigt way" this time. I already had something that i dont really think can be called an api, it was and is just a website like this one (as.macakom.net). But the problem with that was you can only pull data from it, not give it any. That is fine for 90% of functions in lets say Macakom Desktop but you could not interact with your account. You have to message me or email me about what you want to change. I hope that will come to an end once i figure this all out with hosting and more importantly securing it all.

<h3>New site again!</h3><br>
Â redesigned this poor site once again because i felt like doing it. This is 3rd major version so far. First there was html but it was made in publisher so that doesnt really count. 2.0 was a JavaScript app actually that looked and behaved very good on my pc and in IDE but not in a web browser so that didnt last long.
