<h3>Macakom API is Down<br></h3>
_____________________________________________________<br>

Something has went wrong with the vps that hosts Macakom API and other services. I do not know yet what is wrong but i will try to fix it as soon as possible. Services that have been affected: Macakom API site, leaderboars, mikicrep studios account system, and some experimental account things.

This is a new service also knows as Macakom API. I have been waiting so long for this but i finally got myself a vps so i can host a real api and users can interact with it. That means there will be again a new account system that will probably stay for a long time because i am building it to last and to support extending in future. Also users will be able to create accounts on their own and even edit their accounts unlike with previous systems that worked on Macakom AS. Just for info, Macakom AS is of course not going anywhere i will just use it a bit less. api.macakom.net
