The point of the game is to collect oil that willbe thrown down from the sky and with it you have to shoot the roombas that are driving arround.

When game starts your oil tank is full (that is that progress bar on the bottom bar). By shooting roombas you loose 25 ml of oil. When you use up all your oil PDiddy will slide from one point to the other point of the sky and will throw you 5 bottles of baby oil (each one is 25ml). To collect the oil you just have to click on it while it is falling.
