<h1>Welcome to macakom.net</h1><br> <b><h4>We have redesigned our site once again! Now it should be better than ever with much more features and content. For older machines that do not support JS go to macakom.net/lite
<center><h2>MCRS has been discontinued!</h2><br><b><h4>What was MCRS?</h4></b><br>MCRS-Macakom Cable Radio Service was a simple service that you could receive only if you lived close to Macakom's CO (central office). We would place a wire from our CO to your home and you could just plug in a speaker or some kind of amp (depending on your distance) and you would be able to listen to music, talk shows, receive some pictures and more.<br><b><h4>Why did it die?</h4></b><br>Simply put, there was not enough users of this service and we could not achieve 24/7 transmittions. Also rain or snow were sometimes interrupting transmittions because of bad wire joins in some places. It was not needed and it sucked.<br><br>We have pulled all the wires from the ground so we can not just turn it back on. We might place them again and run something else than MCRS over them but that is highly unlikely because the wires are really thin so they cant handle some high power things. Who knows we might finally run our phone service again
