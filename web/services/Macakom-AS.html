Macakom AS (Macakom Application Services) is a service that enables programs and websites made by Macakom to receive new data and information via Internet. Macakom Desktop for example relies on Macakom AS to work because it needs to have new informations published by us. For example when new program gets released, MD goes to AS to get information about it and when you click to download that program it also uses AS to download the file.
